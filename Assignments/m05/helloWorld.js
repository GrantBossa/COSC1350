/* Instructions Part 1
What programming class would be complete without starting out with the traditional "Hello World" programming exercise?!

Under your COSC1350 folder (local), create a folder named m05.
Under the new m05 subfolder, create a file named helloWorld.js (no spaces).
Add a multi-line comment with your name, the filename, and the date.
Declare a variable and assign it the value of "Hello World".
print the variable using the console.log function.
Run your code. To do this, open a terminal session (Terminal > New Terminal) and change to the correct directory under your COSC1350 filepath. In my example below, I added a folder named Assignments and then added my subfolder named m05. Therefore, at the terminal prompt, I typed cd Assignments/m05 to get to the right directory. To run the js file, simply type node helloWorld.js and hit the Enter key.
