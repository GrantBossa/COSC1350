Remember, since the canvas element has the id=myCanvas, selecting it
for styling can be as easy as:

 #myCanvas {
    border-style: solid;
} 
    
Of course, since there will only be one canvas element on the page, you could also just use

canvas {
    border-style: solid;
}

Tip: I like to style my homework assignments to match my text editor's theme.
