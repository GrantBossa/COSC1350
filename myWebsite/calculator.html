Using your template.html, either copy or do a save as calculator.html. Don't forget to update your navigation bar with the new webpage (on all pages). You will need input controls (and associated labels) for the bill amount and for the service quality (tip percentage). The service quality input control will be a drop-down menu with the following options:

Excellent (25%)
Good (20%)
Fair (15%)
Poor (10%)
You will also need a button that will be used to calculate the tip (will tie to the js code you will be creating for your midterm). Your form should look something like the following (as far as functionality goes...you can make it as pretty as you want):

Tip calculator form

Store the input as a variable, and print to the console to make sure you are successfully handling input. Don't forget to update your navigation bar with the new webpage (on all pages).

When ready, upload your local files to your COSC1350 GitHub Repository and commit your changes. Submit the link to your GitHub Repository. This is how I will know that you are ready for me to grade your assignment.

Note: you will be writing the JavaScript code for your midterm. You only need to create the form and styling for this assignment. In other words, add the html components and make it pretty.
